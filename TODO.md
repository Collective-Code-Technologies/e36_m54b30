Tip for full load VANOS table:
Begin from low rpm with max number for your cam (intake 126° , exhaust -105°)
and progressively reduce number until you reach 4000rpm and lowest cam number (intake 86, exhaust -80)

From 4000rpm upwards, use inverse technique, start to rise again numbers, progressively.
(every engine responds different by exhaust config) Test combinations until you are happy.

Also, do changes for intake only, leave exhaust alone if you are on stock exhaust manifold.
